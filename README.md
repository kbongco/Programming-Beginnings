# GPA-Calculator
Hi everyone! 
This is a simple project I'm doing creating a GPA calculator for my friends who are in Rutgers who are still in school. I will 
be expanding this later on to be able to calculate other ones from other schools but for now there will only be one. This is one of my first projects I've made with python that wasn't a small game or anything like that, so the code is still a bit messy for now. I'm trying to incorporate more things to make my code less bulky and run faster, but this is a learning experience for me. 

Some questions answered:<br>
<b>Which python is this running in?</b><br>
Python 3.6.2<br>

<b>Where do I get python?</b><br>
Go onto the python website and go to downloads and download the latest one. <a href="http://www.python.org/downloads">Get Python here!</a> 

<b>So how do I use this?</b><br>
This is one way of opening this there are other ways. So once Python is installed, open up IDLE and run it from there. Follow the instructions and prompts given in the program and it will calculate everything for you. 

<b>Do I include P/F and E credits?</b><br>
No, those are not calculated. 

<b>What about replaced grades?</b><br>
Same as above.<br>

<b>The code keeps breaking in one section and it just stops...?</b><br>
I'm currently working on fixing that part. Stay tuned!<br>
